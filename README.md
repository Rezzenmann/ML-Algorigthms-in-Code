# ML-Algorigthms-in-Code

I am strongly believing that mostly all of us need to understand properly things we are doing, especially in terms of Data Science & Machine Learning field.

In this repository I will add some realization of most common ( or not) ML from scratch and, therefore, comparison with usual ones from Sklearn.


Already done:
- KNN Classifier
- Linear Regression using OLS and Gradient Descent
